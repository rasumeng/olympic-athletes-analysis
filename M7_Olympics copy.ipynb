    "* **Athlete Information:** ID, Name, Sex, Age, Height (cm), Weight (kg)\n",
    "* **Organizational Data:** Team, NOC (National Olympic Committee code), Country\n",
    "* **Event Details:** Games (year and season), Season (Summer/Winter), City, Sport, Event category\n",
    "* **Performance:** Medal (Gold, Silver, or Bronze)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Scope:** 1896–2016 Olympic Games; includes only medalists (athletes who won at least one medal)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** Missing values exist in Age, Height, Weight, and Country fields. These represent data unavailability rather than zero values, and analyses appropriately exclude missing data from calculations to maintain accuracy.\n",

Understanding this variation is essential to recognizing that \"Olympic athlete\" describes vastly different physical profiles and career trajectories."

    "**Story Angle:** While popular culture portrays Olympic athletes as primarily young adults in their prime physical years, analysis reveals surprising longevity among medalists in specific sports. A handful of competitors have achieved Olympic success well beyond typical athletic prime age, suggesting that sport type, training methodology, and individual resilience significantly influence career trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supporting Evidence:** \n",
    "- Age range of medalists spans from youngest to oldest, indicating sport-specific demographic variation\n",
    "- Concentration of older medalists in disciplines like shooting and equestrian suggests that strategic thinking, technical precision, and experience may outweigh youth-dependent physical attributes in certain Olympic sports\n",
    "- Comparison across Summer and Winter Olympic sports reveals different age profiles, potentially reflecting recruitment strategies and sport-specific physical demands\n",

It provides inspirational examples of athlete resilience while revealing data-driven patterns about which disciplines reward experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps for Investigation:**\n",
    "- Interview older medalists about training adaptations and career longevity strategies\n",
    "- Analyze longitudinal data on athlete age across decades to assess whether average medalist age is shifting\n",
